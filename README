SoundComments Demo
==================

Concept
-------

The idea here is to visually link comment activity and an audio
stream, in order to provide a quick content cue that allows a
reader/listener to efficiently locate and follow items of interest
or controversy. By tracking the number of comments in a contextual
comment system and indicating higher numbers along a timeline or a
graphical representation of the audio stream, this experiment is a
sketched first attempt at visually tying active conversations to
streaming audio content.
